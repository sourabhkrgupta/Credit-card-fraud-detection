# Credit-card-fraud-detection

**Project Title: Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning**

* Developed a credit card fraud detection system on a large, imbalanced dataset of over 280,000 transactions, demonstrating proficiency in machine learning techniques.
* Conducted data preprocessing, including feature scaling and power transformation, to prepare the dataset for effective model training.
* Addressed severe class imbalance by applying SMOTE oversampling, significantly enhancing the detection of minority class instances.
* Implemented and evaluated multiple classification models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, XGBoost) using metrics suitable for imbalanced datasets (ROC AUC, Precision, Recall, F1-Score).
* Optimized model performance through hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV and cross-validation, ensuring robust evaluation.
* Leveraged GPU acceleration for XGBoost to significantly reduce model training time on the large dataset.
* Selected the optimal model (XGBoost) based on a balance of fraud detection rate (Recall) and minimizing false positives (Precision).
